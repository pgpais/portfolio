Games are typically designed for a specific target audience, with a narrowly defined set of expectations that are placed on players (e.g. sighted strategy gamer). In this project, we explored how to decouple the gameplay experience to cater to different sets of constraints simultaneously, while maintaining the benefits of shared play. The approach is inspired by ability-based design where there is a shift from “what can everyone do?” to “what can a person do?”, emphasizing individual abilities, rather than their limitations/disabilities. For game design, we can start to envision asymmetric experiences that go beyond abilities and cater to complex sets constraints.
